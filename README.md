# watchlist-rb
OS X Desktop notifications for MediaWiki watchlist updates

## Configuration
Configuration is done through a YAML file. See example.yaml.

## Running
Right now, you have to manually run the app through Terminal and pass the YAML file path as its single argument.

## TODO
* .app bundles
* Check a specific directory (~/.watchlist.yaml maybe?) for the config.
* Proper icon.
